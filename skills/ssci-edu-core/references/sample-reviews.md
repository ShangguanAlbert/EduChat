## Major Revision示例

### 示例1：方法论需要重大改进

```
Overall Recommendation: Major Revision

This manuscript explores [research topic] using [methodology]. While the research question is important, the current methodology has significant limitations that need to be addressed.

Major Issues:

1. Research Design Concerns (Pages 6-8):
The quasi-experimental design without randomization limits the causal claims that can be made. Given that the study aims to demonstrate the effectiveness of [intervention], stronger controls are needed. Please consider:
- Adding a comparison group if possible
- Using propensity score matching to create equivalent groups
- Limiting causal language and clearly acknowledging the design limitations

2. Measurement Issues (Pages 8-9):
The validity of the primary outcome measure is not adequately established. Specifically:
- The measure was adapted from another context without validation
- No evidence of reliability (e.g., Cronbach's alpha) is provided
- There may be ceiling effects given the reported means

I recommend either:
- Providing validation evidence for this specific population
- Using established, validated measures
- Acknowledging this as a significant limitation and discussing its implications

3. Sample Size and Power (Page 7):
The sample size (N=52) appears insufficient for the complex analyses conducted (multiple regression with 6 predictors). A power analysis or justification for the sample size is needed. If the sample is indeed too small, consider:
- Simplifying the analyses
- Collecting additional data
- Acknowledging limited statistical power

4. Missing Data Handling (Page 9, Lines 180-190):
The manuscript reports 25% missing data but does not adequately describe how this was handled. Please:
- Report the pattern of missingness (MCAR/MAR/MNAR)
- Justify the chosen missing data technique
- Conduct sensitivity analyses to examine the impact of missing data assumptions

Minor Issues:

1. Literature Review (Pages 3-5):
The review focuses heavily on older studies (pre-2015). More recent literature should be incorporated, particularly regarding [specific topic].

2. Theoretical Framework (Page 4):
The connection between the stated theoretical framework and the actual study design is tenuous. Please either strengthen this connection or reconsider the theoretical framing.

3. Writing Quality:
The manuscript requires significant editing for clarity and flow. Specific issues include:
- Long, complex sentences that hinder comprehension
- Inconsistent terminology
- Unclear transitions between sections

Overall Assessment:
The research addresses an important topic, but the methodological limitations are substantial enough to warrant major revision. If the authors can adequately address the major issues, particularly regarding research design and measurement, the manuscript will be much stronger. I recommend resubmission after major revision with re-review.

### 示例2：数据分析需要重做

```
Overall Recommendation: Major Revision

This manuscript presents [brief description of study]. While the data collection appears thorough, the analysis has significant problems that undermine the conclusions.

Major Issues:

1. Analytical Approach (Pages 10-12):
The statistical methods used are inappropriate for the research questions and data structure:
- The use of multiple t-tests instead of ANOVA inflates Type I error
- The data appear to be hierarchical (students nested in classrooms), but this structure is ignored
- Effect sizes are not reported

The analysis needs to be redone using:
- Multilevel modeling to account for nesting
- Appropriate post-hoc tests with corrections for multiple comparisons
- Comprehensive effect size reporting

2. Interpretation of Results (Pages 12-13):
Several conclusions are not supported by the data:
- Page 12, Lines 240-245: The claim that "the intervention was highly effective" is overstated given the small effect size (d=0.25).
- Page 13, Lines 260-265: The generalization to "all K-12 students" is not justified by the sample (urban middle schools only).

3. Qualitative Analysis (Pages 13-14):
The qualitative component lacks transparency:
- The coding process is not described in sufficient detail
- No evidence of data saturation is provided
- Representative quotes are missing for several themes
- The integration of quantitative and qualitative findings is superficial

Please provide:
- A detailed description of the analytical procedure
- Evidence of rigor (e.g., inter-rater reliability, audit trail)
- More comprehensive presentation of qualitative findings
- Clear integration strategy

4. Ethical Considerations (Page 7):
The ethical approval section is insufficient. Please provide:
- Name of the ethics committee
- Approval number
- Details of informed consent procedures
- Information about how participant confidentiality was protected

Minor Issues:

1. Introduction (Pages 2-3):
The research questions emerge somewhat abruptly. Please provide clearer rationale leading up to the questions.

2. Tables and Figures:
- Table 2 is unnecessary (raw data can be provided as supplementary material)
- Figure 3 is difficult to read; consider redesigning
- All tables need more informative titles

3. References:
Several references are incomplete or improperly formatted. Please check carefully against the journal guidelines.

Overall Assessment:
This manuscript requires substantial revision, particularly in the analytical approach. If the authors can address the major methodological concerns, the study has the potential to make a meaningful contribution. However, given the extent of the required changes, I recommend re-review after major revision.

### 示例3：理论贡献不足

```
Overall Recommendation: Major Revision

This manuscript reports on [brief description]. While the empirical work is competent, the theoretical contribution is currently underdeveloped.

Major Issues:

1. Theoretical Contribution (Throughout):
The manuscript claims to advance [theoretical perspective], but the actual contribution to theory is unclear. Specifically:
- No new theoretical insights are offered
- The findings largely confirm what is already known
- The implications for theory are not articulated

To strengthen the theoretical contribution, please consider:
- Developing a more nuanced theoretical framework that generates testable predictions
- Using the findings to refine or extend existing theory
- Contributing to theory-building through systematic comparison with prior research

2. Literature Synthesis (Pages 4-6):
The literature review is primarily descriptive rather than analytical. It reads as a series of summaries rather than a coherent synthesis. Please:
- Organize around themes or debates rather than individual studies
- Critically evaluate existing research, not just describe it
- More clearly articulate the gap this study addresses
- Develop an integrated framework that motivates the study

3. Research Questions (Page 6):
The research questions are somewhat broad and do not clearly connect to the theoretical framework. Please revise to:
- Be more specific and focused
- Clearly link to the theoretical framework
- Be answerable with the chosen methodology

4. Discussion (Pages 14-16):
The discussion does not fully capitalize on the potential theoretical contributions:
- The findings are not adequately connected to prior literature
- Theoretical implications are stated in general terms without specificity
- Alternative explanations for the findings are not considered

The discussion should be expanded to:
- Explicitly address how findings support, extend, or challenge existing theory
- Consider competing theoretical explanations
- Develop a more nuanced understanding of [phenomenon]

Minor Issues:

1. Methodology (Pages 7-10):
While generally sound, some additional details would strengthen the manuscript:
- More information about the context and participants
- Rationale for specific analytical choices
- Member checking or other credibility strategies

2. Writing and Organization:
The manuscript is generally well-written but could be improved:
- Some sections are repetitive (particularly the introduction and discussion)
- Transitions between sections could be smoother
- Several jargon terms need to be defined

Overall Assessment:
The empirical work is methodologically sound, but the manuscript currently falls short of making a strong theoretical contribution, which is essential for publication in [Journal Name]. If the authors can substantially strengthen the theoretical framing and clearly articulate the theoretical contribution, this could be a valuable paper. However, this will require major revision and re-review.

## Reject示例

### 示例1：方法论存在严重缺陷

```
Overall Recommendation: Reject

This manuscript investigates [research topic] using [methodology]. Unfortunately, the study has fundamental methodological limitations that cannot be adequately addressed through revision.

Major Concerns:

1. Research Design Flaws (Pages 6-8):
The study employs a single-group post-test only design, which provides no basis for attributing outcomes to the intervention. Without a comparison group or baseline measurement, it is impossible to draw any meaningful conclusions about effectiveness. This is a fatal flaw that cannot be remedied without completely redesigning and re-conducting the study.

2. Sample Issues (Page 7):
The sample (N=23) is far too small for any meaningful statistical analysis. The post-hoc power analysis reveals power of only 0.35 to detect a large effect. Moreover, the sampling method (convenience sampling from a single site) severely limits generalizability.

3. Measurement Problems (Pages 8-9):
The primary outcome measure was developed by the authors without any validation. No evidence of reliability, validity, or appropriateness for this population is provided. The measure appears to have face validity issues, and the response scale is problematic.

4. Analytical Errors (Pages 10-11):
Multiple inappropriate statistical analyses were conducted, including:
- Violation of parametric test assumptions (no normality checks reported)
- Multiple comparisons without correction
- Over-interpretation of non-significant trends

Minor Issues:

1. The literature review is outdated and misses key recent developments in the field.
2. The writing quality is poor, with numerous grammatical errors and unclear passages.
3. The ethical approval section is vague and inadequate.

Overall Assessment:
While the topic is relevant to educational research, the methodological problems are too severe to be addressed through revision. The study would need to be completely redesigned and replicated with rigorous methods. I cannot recommend publication in its current form.
```

### 示例2：不符合期刊范围

```
Overall Recommendation: Reject (Outside Scope)

This manuscript reports on [brief description of study]. While the study is competently executed, it does not meet the scope requirements of [Journal Name].

Major Concerns:

1. Limited Connection to Educational Technology:
The study focuses on [general education topic] with minimal connection to technology. The technology component (brief mention of using online surveys for data collection) is incidental rather than central to the research. [Journal Name] specifically requires that technology be a central focus of the research, not merely a data collection tool.

2. Lack of Theoretical Engagement with Technology:
The manuscript does not engage with theoretical perspectives specific to educational technology. There is no discussion of:
- Technology-enhanced learning theories
- Technology integration frameworks
- Issues specific to technology-mediated instruction

3. Limited Practical Implications for Technology Use:
The findings and implications are general to [topic] and do not specifically address:
- Technology design or implementation
- Technology-supported pedagogy
- Digital learning environments

Quality of the Study:
While I must recommend rejection on scope grounds, I should note that the study itself is methodologically sound:
- The research design is appropriate for the research questions
- The sample is adequate and well-described
- The analysis is appropriate and well-executed
- The writing is clear and professional

Recommendations:
This manuscript may be more appropriate for a general education journal such as [suggest alternative journals]. With some revision to emphasize any technology-related aspects (if applicable), it might also be suitable for journals focusing on [alternative topic area].

Overall Assessment:
The manuscript is well-executed but falls outside the scope of [Journal Name], which requires a central focus on educational technology. I recommend submission to a more appropriate venue.

### 示例3：缺乏原创性贡献

```
Overall Recommendation: Reject (Insufficient Original Contribution)

This manuscript examines [research topic] using [methodology]. While the study is technically competent, it does not make a sufficient original contribution to warrant publication in [Journal Name].

Major Concerns:

1. Lack of Novelty:
The study largely replicates prior research without adding new insights. Specifically:
- The research questions have been addressed in multiple previous studies (e.g., [Citation 1], [Citation 2], [Citation 3])
- The findings closely mirror those already reported in the literature
- No new theoretical insights or practical applications are offered

2. Incremental Contribution:
The stated contribution is minimal:
- The study uses a slightly different population but yields the same conclusions as prior work
- The methodological variations do not lead to different or enhanced understanding
- The findings do not challenge, extend, or refine existing knowledge

3. Limited Theoretical Engagement:
The study applies an existing theoretical framework without:
- Testing boundary conditions
- Extending the theory to new contexts
- Resolving theoretical tensions or contradictions
- Generating new theoretical propositions

4. Practical Contribution:
The implications for practice are generic and not substantially different from existing recommendations:
- The practical suggestions could be inferred from prior research
- No specific, actionable guidance is provided
- The generalizability to practice settings is not established

Positive Aspects:
- The methodology is rigorous and well-documented
- The writing is clear and professional
- The analysis is appropriate and thorough

Recommendations:
For this work to be publishable, it would need to:
- Identify a more specific gap in the literature
- Make a clearer theoretical contribution
- Offer novel practical implications
- Or, consider reframing as a replication study with explicit attention to generalizability

Overall Assessment:
While the study is competently executed, the contribution is too incremental for [Journal Name]. The field would not be substantially advanced by the publication of these findings. I recommend rejection but encourage the authors to consider whether this work might form part of a larger program of research with greater cumulative impact.

## 针对不同研究类型的示例

### 系统综述审稿意见

```
Overall Recommendation: Major Revision

This manuscript presents a systematic review of [topic]. While the review addresses an important area, several methodological aspects require substantial revision.

Major Issues:

1. Search Strategy (Pages 5-6):
The search strategy has significant limitations:
- Only two databases were searched (Web of Science and ERIC). Additional databases such as Scopus, PsycINFO, and IEEE Xplore should be included.
- The search terms appear limited. The authors should include additional synonyms and related terms.
- No mention of searching reference lists or contacting experts, which are recommended practices.

2. Inclusion/Exclusion Criteria (Page 6):
The criteria are insufficiently specified:
- Publication date range needs justification
- Language restrictions should be acknowledged and justified
- The criteria for "quality" studies are not defined

3. Quality Appraisal (Page 7):
The quality assessment is inadequate:
- The tool used is not fully described
- Inter-rater reliability for quality ratings is not reported
- The results of quality appraisal are not incorporated into the synthesis

4. Synthesis Method (Pages 8-9):
The synthesis approach lacks rigor:
- Thematic analysis procedures are not fully described
- The process of developing themes is opaque
- The connection between extracted data and synthesized themes is unclear

Minor Issues:

1. The PRISMA flow diagram is not provided but should be included.
2. Several recently published relevant studies are not included (published after the search date but within reasonable timeframe).
3. The discussion does not adequately address the strength of evidence or implications for future research.

Overall Assessment:
The review addresses an important topic, but the methodology does not currently meet standards for high-quality systematic reviews. Major revisions to the search strategy, quality appraisal, and synthesis methods are needed. I recommend resubmission after major revision.
```

### 设计型研究（DBR）审稿意见

```
Overall Recommendation: Minor Revision

This manuscript reports a design-based research study developing and evaluating [educational intervention]. The study demonstrates many strengths of the DBR methodology and offers practical contributions.

Strengths:
1. The iterative design process is well-documented across three cycles.
2. The theoretical grounding in [theory] is clearly articulated.
3. The collaboration with practitioners enhances ecological validity.
4. The use of multiple data sources provides rich understanding of the design process.

Minor Issues:

1. Design Principles (Page 12):
While design principles are presented, they could be strengthened by:
- More explicitly connecting each principle to the design iterations
- Providing more specific guidance for implementation
- Discussing the scope of applicability (what contexts these principles apply to)

2. Generalization Claims (Page 15):
The discussion of generalizability needs nuance. While DBR does not aim for statistical generalization, the authors should more clearly articulate:
- The theoretical generalizations being claimed
- The boundaries of the design principles
- How these might apply to different contexts

3. Role of Researchers (Page 7):
The researcher involvement in the design process is described, but more reflection on:
- How researcher decisions shaped the outcomes
- Potential researcher biases
- The balance between researcher and practitioner input

4. Refinement Process (Pages 9-11):
The documentation of design changes between iterations could be clearer. A table summarizing:
- What was changed
- Why it was changed (based on what evidence)
- What effect the change had

Overall Assessment:
This is a well-conducted DBR study that makes valuable contributions to both theory and practice. The requested revisions will strengthen the manuscript but are relatively minor. I recommend publication after minor revision.

### 学习分析研究审稿意见

```
Overall Recommendation: Major Revision

This manuscript presents a learning analytics study examining [research focus]. While the use of fine-grained data is promising, several analytical and ethical issues need to be addressed.

Major Issues:

1. Analytical Approach (Pages 9-11):
The machine learning methods are not fully appropriate for the research questions:
- The model selection rationale is unclear
- Feature engineering decisions lack justification
- Model validation procedures are insufficient (single train-test split reported; cross-validation needed)
- Overfitting concerns are not addressed

2. Interpretability (Pages 11-12):
The "black box" nature of the models limits educational utility:
- Feature importance is reported but not interpreted educationally
- The models identify patterns but do not explain why these patterns occur
- Practical implications are limited without actionable insights

3. Ethical Considerations (Page 7):
The ethics section is inadequate for learning analytics research:
- Informed consent procedures for trace data collection are not described
- Data privacy and security measures are not detailed
- Potential for algorithmic bias is not discussed
- Student rights regarding their data are not addressed

4. Validity of Behavioral Measures (Page 8):
The behavioral indicators used as proxies for learning need validation:
- The relationship between clickstream data and actual learning is assumed rather than demonstrated
- No validation against external measures (e.g., assessments, observations)
- The construct validity of the behavioral measures is not established

Minor Issues:

1. The literature review could better integrate learning analytics and educational data mining perspectives.
2. The visualization of results could be improved for better interpretability.
3. Several technical terms need to be defined for the educational audience.

Overall Assessment:
The study addresses an important topic and uses rich data sources, but the analytical approach and ethical considerations need substantial strengthening. The manuscript would benefit from more careful attention to model validation, interpretability, and ethical issues specific to learning analytics. I recommend major revision and re-review.
